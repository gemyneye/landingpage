## Lessons learned
Beginning a project with a basic layout first visually is key. Luckily, I have a lot of experience at 
work with projects that have helped me start with basic ideas first. I did the layout breaking down the 
various boxes, then I laid out the HTML bones. Once I got the basic boxes laid out with structure, I
began to work on each section top down. I used previous TOP lessons, CSS blog by Josh W Comeau https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/interactive-guide-to-flexbox/?from=newsletter, and MDN 
webdocs as resources.
